            <button class="collapsible">When is the best time to take a “Love your Birth” course?</button>
            <div class="content">
                I would recommend taking on a course between the 24th-30th week of pregnancy. This will give you enough time
                to complete the course and to practice the tools and techniques. Practice is absolutely vital to the 
                effectiveness of the tools and techniques during labour.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <!--POTENTIAL QUESTION TO BE ADDED
            <button class="collapsible">What if I am beyond 30 weeks pregnant, and wanting to do the course?</button>
            <div class="content">
            Don’t worry! Although the longer you have to practice the easier you will find to implement the techniques,
            that is not to say that you won’t have the same benefit if you undertake the course later on. You could also
            consider booking a 1-2-1 course which can be run over a weekend which means you will have all of the information
            quicker and will be able to start your practicing at the earliest opportunity.

            <button class="collapsible">Do you offer group courses?</button>
            <div class="content">
                No, we do not offer group courses at this time. This is because we feel that offering the course on a 1-2-1
                basis means that we can ensure that we meet the individualised needs fully. However, if you have a friend 
                who also wants to undertake the course, it can be arranged for you to share your sessions and split the cost.
                (Max. 2 couples)

            <button class="collapsible">What is included in the cost of the course?</button>
            <div class="content">
                The breakdown of what is included in each course is detailed on the ‘courses’ page. You will also receive a
                30 minute skype session/phone call first to discover what it is you hope to gain from the course, all course
                materials and a goodie bag.

            <button class="collapsible">Does my partner need to attend?</button>
            <div class="content">
                It is recommended that your birth partner attends the course as it is helpful for them to understand the tools
                and techniques you will be using during labour and also to understand your wishes and preferences so that they
                are able to advocate on your behalf. 
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <button class="collapsible">You teach hypnobirthing techniques. Does this mean I will be out of control of my body?</button>
            <div class="content">
                Not at all! Much the opposite actually! The techniques taught on the ‘Love your Birth’ courses come from the
                practice of hypnobirthing. Hypnobirthing refers to the ability to enter a state of deep relaxation where you
                are aware of sensations and your surroundings, but are not distracted by them. The tools and techniques you 
                will be taught will help you to create anchors for that deep relaxation, that you can tap in to during labour.
                You will not be able to control the sensations within your body during labour, but with the use of these tools
                and techniques you will FEEL in control, because you will be able to understand the physiology.
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <button class="collapsible">Does using hypnobirthing techniques guarantee a pain free experience?</button>
            <div class="content">
                Everyone’s perceptions of pain will be different. Because of this, we cannot guarantee a pain free experience.
                But from the knowledge you will gain and tools and techniques you can practice, this will reduce the element
                of fear. Fear is physiologically a big contributor to the level of pain experienced. It has been shown that
                people who use hypnobirthing techniques during labour are less likely to request the stronger forms of
                analgesia, and describe their births as powerful as opposed to painful.

            <button class="collapsible">This is not my first baby, will this course be suitable for me?</button>
            <div class="content">
                Yes! The ‘Love your Birth’ course is suitable for all women. We offer a refresher course for those who have
                completed a hypnobirthing based course previously. However, unless you have completed a ‘Love your Birth’ 
                course before, I would highly recommend taking the full birth course as the ‘Love your Birth’ courses are 
                highly unique.

            <button class="collapsible">This is my first baby and I am also nervous about becoming a parent. Do the
                ‘Love your Birth’ courses cover more than labour and birth?</button>
            <div class="content">
                Absolutely! We also cover preparation for parenthood where we discuss basic baby care, feeding
                (breast and bottle), amongst other things to help you feel prepared for your new arrival! 
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <button class="collapsible">Do I have to pay the full cost of the course up front?</button>
            <div class="content">
                You can book on to a course with a £50 deposit, with the remainder of the amount due prior to the
                commencement of your course.

            <button class="collapsible">What if I am planning an elective caesarean section (C-section) for my birth?</button>
            <div class="content">
                For whatever reason you have chosen, with your care providers, to opt for an elective caesarean, the
                ‘Love your Birth’ course can still be of great use to you. It can be quite a nerve wracking experience,
                so we still cover all of the breathing techniques. We also discuss the process of a caesarean, and some
                of the preferences you can opt for to still allow for beautiful bonding with your baby.
